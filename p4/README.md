# Exploratory Data Analysis using R
## Overview
I used R to explore the white wine quality data set. I found that 
among all 11 chemical parameters, alcohol and density were strongest influence factors of white wine quality.
 Better wines had higher alcohol content and lower density. 
 I had used **dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, GGally and other four R libraries** to 
**transform, analyze, visualize the data, do statistical tests and build regression models.**
