# Interactive Data Visualization on Website
## Overview
Here I used **D3.js and Dimple.js** to visualize my discovery of P1 **on website.** 
I created 4 precnt bars to show the association between 'ticket classes, gender, 
age and port of embarkation' and 'death rates of Titanic passengers'. 
**All the plots were interactive**. You can put your cursor on the plot to see exact counts.
