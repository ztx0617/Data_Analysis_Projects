# Tianxing Zhai's Data Science Projects
Welcome to my projects presentation space! Below are overviews of all my projects:
## Machine learning projects
### Deep learning: Flower Image Classifier

### Unsupervised learning: Identify Customer Segments

## Other data analysis projects
### Investigate a Dataset
I used Python to explore the 
Titanic passengers survival data set. I found that ticket class, gender, age, companionship and 
port of embarkation were significantly associated with survival rates 
of passengers on Titanic. I had used **Pandas, Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib** libraries to 
**transform, analyze, visualize the data and do statistical tests**.

### Mine and Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data
Here I mined and wrangled the Washington city map data and exported it to a relational database.


Firstly, I **extracted the map data from XML files** and transformed them into five separate csv files. 
The five csv files stored nodes, node-tags, ways, way-tags and ways-nodes connection data 
separately. Secondly, I loaded the csv files to Pandas dataframes and cleaned them. 
Thirdly, I uesed sqlite3-Python API to create a empty **relational database** which had five tables
with **appropriate primary keys and foreign keys**. Then I exported the data to the database. 
Finally, I ran some **SQL queries** to explore the database.

### Exploratory Data Analysis using R
I used R to explore the white wine quality data set. I found that 
among all 11 chemical parameters, alcohol and density were strongest influence factors of white wine quality.
 Better wines had higher alcohol content and lower density. 
 I had used **dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, GGally and other four R libraries** to 
**transform, analyze, visualize the data, do statistical tests and build regression models.**
