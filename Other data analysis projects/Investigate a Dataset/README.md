# Exploratory Data Analysis using Python
## Overview
I used Python to explore the 
Titanic passengers survival data set. I found that ticket class, gender, age, companionship and 
port of embarkation were significantly associated with survival rates 
of passengers on Titanic. I had used **Pandas, Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib** libraries to 
**transform, analyze, visualize the data and do statistical tests**.
